# Definitions and Concepts

**Nakamoto Coefficient**:

**Minimum Attack Vector (MAV)**: 

**k**:

**k-effective**: 
“K-effective” is hereby used to measure the “average resulting decentralization” and is computed using Equation 1. The Nakamoto Coefficient is approximately half of k-effective rounded up to the nearest integer. K-effective provides a higher resolution quantification of network decentralization compared to the Nakamoto Coefficient.
