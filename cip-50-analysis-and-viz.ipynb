    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- $R$ - The total available reward per pool per epoch (in ada).\n",
    "- $k$ - [0,inf) The desired number of pools\n",
    "- $a_0$ - [0,inf) The influence of stake pledged by the owners should have on the desirability of the pool. Small values of a0 indicate little influence.\n",
    "- $\\rho$ - [0,1] Rho is the monetary expansion rate, determining the fraction of still available ada that will be created per epoch.\n",
    "- $\\tau$ - [0,1] Tau is the fraction of rewards going to the treasury.\n",
    "- $\\eta$ - Eta is the ratio between the number of blocks produced vs expected in an epoch (i.e. missed blocks lower eta)\n",
    "- $T_{\\infty}$ - The maximal amount of ada to ever be in circulation ($45*10^9$ Ada)\n",
    "- $T$ - The amount of ada in circulation at the beginning of the epoch for which we want to calculate the rewards pot.\n",
    "- $fees$ - The transaction fees (tx) in an epoch\n",
    "- _active stake_ - The amount of stake delgated to active pools.  \n",
    "- _total stake_ - The total supply of ada, with a % not delegated or in dead pools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stake Pool Parameters\n",
    "- $costs, c$ (minFee) - (340+) minimum fee cost for a pool mining a block (min 340 ada)\n",
    "- $margin, m, \\pi$  - (0,1] the pool operator margin or percent % taken from block mining rewards off the top before delegators.\n",
    "- $pledge, \\lambda, s$ - the relative stake of the pool owners, or the amount of ada pledged during pool registration.\n",
    "- $sigma, \\sigma$ - [0,1] the relative stake of the pool, total stake of the pool, relative to the _total stake_, not the active stake. \n",
    "    - note: includes the stake s, pledge, or lambda pledged by the pool owners\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the total supply of ada is T = 31,000,000,000 and the pool owners pledge (s, lambda) is 15,500,000, and the pool attracts 15,500,000 of ada delegation from pool members, then:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Monetary Expansion\n",
    "The monetary expansion is the expanding circulating supply of ada in a given epoch. Since cardano is based on a fixed total supply, every new epoch issues less new ada, a depreciating new amount issued, just like bitcoin.\n",
