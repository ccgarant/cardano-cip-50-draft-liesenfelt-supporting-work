# CIP-50 Analysis and Data Visualization Topics

# Must have

## Current Reward Formula Exploration
- with sliders to interactively explore
- static examples from cip50 as guided exploration
## New Reward Formula Exploration
- with sliders to interactively explore
- static examples from cip50 as guided exploration
## Stake Pools Landscape
Compare contrast individual stake pool then grouped stake pools to highlight k-effective
- delegation amount total bar graph (see big tail)
	- color code top 500? top k-effective? top Nakamoto coefficient?
- stake vs leverage
	- color code top 500? color code for groups? sSPO alliances?
	- prove point of small mSPO vs big private pools.
- time history of stake pools and sizes video (ref: https://youtu.be/hVimVzgtD6w?t=706)
## Private vs Public Stake Pools
- what % are private vs public
- what do they look like, a0 and k?
## Computational Efficiency
 - compare contrast current vs proposed timeit w/ stress test.

# Near term future work

## Event timeline and MAV / k-effective
- what events caused changes to decentralization? how best to viz?
	- e.g. sundaeswap, and reverse sundaeswap.
	- does tweeter shitposting / bashing make a difference?
	- what moves the needle, what events? lessons learned?
## How to make run off live current data vs static data?
- how to make notebook run off live data rather than static snapshot?
- give epoch range selection?
- make a live website?
	- include cardano staking intro education and principles
## Bitcoin comparisons
- MAV comparison

----------

**Things to consider**
- linear vs log scale, log-log scale
- reader should come away with a very intuitive understanding of rewards schemes thru experience, interaction, and visualization.
- i should have a great understanding and comfortable with proposal thru interaction and visualization.
- think about other reward schemes?

---------------------
**Thoughts**
- include fun quiz with levels, and rewards in live website?
	- raffle, those that complete the training are eligible for the 50/50 raffle (think ergo raffle).
	- those that stake to sSPOs can enter into 50/50 raffle, can donate to the raffle (tax deductible)?
- when dataviz finished, request Michael to do a youtube whitepaper video on cip-50, mainly explaining the benefits of the new reward formula.
